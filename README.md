No one enjoys standing in a queue for the payment. During holiday seasons, this becomes more chaotic.
Billing in Mall takes lot of time because people have to wait for a long time in a queue for scanning of products and billing. Looking at the advancement in technology, we came up with an innovative idea of “Smart Shopping Cart for Automatic Object Detection and Billing”.

We are trying to tackle it with a smart solution. The customers can simply pick up the item and drop it in the cart. And then the sensor will do everything needed. It will identify the items on the cart, match up the price and then as the shopping spree ends, the users can swipe their card at the payment terminal.
