Abstract:

With a problem of waiting in a long queue to check-out the shopping items. Our team is developing a Smart Shopping Cart, a system that allows faster check-out. A device that consists of a display screen, AI object detection camera, microprocessor, IR and weight sensor, Zigbee will be implemented on the shopping cart. The customer would simply drop items into the cart or remove it, and the sensor will automize the billing process. The information will be stored and checked against a database to retrieve the appropriate information and update the cart. It also enables the microprocessor to calculate the total price for all scanned items, and display it on the cart screen. Additionally, the concept of Market Basket Analysis and Deep Learning are implemented to recommend items in the store and a GPS system to track the cart. At last, counter with least number of queues will be detected and displayed on the cart LCD. Then, the final bill will be transferred to the counter having least waiting list using Zigbee. The total price will be sent to the cashier using a tag for the respective cart, and the receipt will be automatically printed. All the customer has to do is to pay for the total price without unloading the items from the cart. The team expects that the smart shopping cart will be a more reliable form of check-out process that will decrease the amount of time a customer has to wait while shopping.
